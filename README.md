# Eso — Backend Skeleton

Django REST Framework backend for the Eso hackathon MVP. Handles transaction
intake, calls out to the ML dev's scoring service, and maintains the
transparency ledger.

## Structure

```
eso_backend/
├── eso_backend/        # project config (settings, root urls)
├── transactions/        # the one app — everything lives here for a hackathon scope
│   ├── models.py         # Transaction, BehaviorBaseline, LedgerEntry
│   ├── serializers.py     # request/response validation
│   ├── services.py        # business logic + ML service integration (the important file)
│   ├── views.py            # thin — just calls services.py and returns a Response
│   └── urls.py
├── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```

**Why a `services.py` layer:** views should just handle HTTP in/out. All the
actual logic — talking to the ML service, deciding what counts as risky,
writing to the ledger — lives in `services.py`. This means when the ML dev's
endpoint contract changes (and it will, mid-hackathon), you edit one file,
not scattered logic across every view.

## API Routes

| Method | Route | Auth? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register/` | No | Create an account, returns tokens immediately |
| POST | `/api/auth/login/` | No | Log in, returns access + refresh tokens |
| POST | `/api/auth/refresh/` | No | Exchange a refresh token for a new access token |
| GET | `/api/auth/me/` | Yes | Confirm which user a token belongs to |
| GET | `/api/me/baseline/` | Yes | Get (or auto-create) the current user's behavioral baseline |
| POST | `/api/transactions/` | Yes | Submit a transaction — scores it immediately, returns approved/flagged |
| GET | `/api/transactions/<id>/` | Yes | Fetch a transaction's current state (owner only) |
| POST | `/api/transactions/<id>/decision/` | Yes | User confirms or cancels a flagged transaction (owner only) |
| GET | `/api/me/ledger/` | Yes | Transparency log for the activity screen |

**Auth is JWT-based** (`djangorestframework-simplejwt`). All routes except
register/login/refresh require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
`user_id` is never accepted from the client — it's always derived from the
authenticated token, so nobody can submit transactions or read data under
someone else's identity. See `HOW_TO_RUN.md` for the full request examples.

## Integrating with the ML dev

Set `ML_SCORING_SERVICE_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8001/score`) via
a `.env` file — don't hardcode a teammate's local IP into the codebase.

**Agree this contract with the ML dev before they build anything:**

Request sent to their FastAPI endpoint:
```json
{
  "user_id": "u123",
  "recipient": "new_recipient_456",
  "amount": 450000,
  "device_id": "device_abc",
  "hour_of_day": 2,
  "baseline": {
    "typical_recipients": ["r1", "r2"],
    "typical_amount_min": 1000,
    "typical_amount_max": 50000,
    "typical_hours": [7, 8, 9, "..."],
    "known_devices": ["device_abc"]
  }
}
```

Expected response:
```json
{ "risk_score": 0.87, "reason": "New recipient, amount 9x typical, late-night timing" }
```

If the ML service is down or times out, `services.py` fails safe: it flags
the transaction for manual review rather than silently approving it.

## Running it

See `HOW_TO_RUN.md` for full setup, local testing with curl, running
alongside the ML dev's service, and deployment steps for the Live URL
submission requirement.

## Not in scope for the hackathon MVP

- No payment gateway of any kind — transactions are simulated end-to-end.
  This matches the Stage 1 proposal's hackathon MVP scope (section 8.2:
  simulated transaction data), so it's not a gap against what was promised.
- No real Mono/Okra account-aggregation integration — that's phase 3 in the
  proposal, post-hackathon.
