TRANSACTION DATA:
- Recipient: {recipient_context}
- Amount: {amount_context}
- Device: {"NEW device — not seen before" if transaction.device_id and transaction.device_id not in (baseline.known_devices or []) else "Recognised device"}
- Time: {hour_context}
- Total known recipients in user history: {len(known_recipients)}

NIGERIAN FRAUD PATTERNS (detect these explicitly):
1. SIM-swap: unknown recipient + large or unusual amount → instant urgency
2. Account takeover: new device + high amount → session hijack
3. Social-engineering: suspicious recipient name (government titles, urgent keywords, "President", "FG", "EFCC", "refund") → social scam
4. Late-night wire: transfer post 22:00 or pre-06:00 → high risk
5. Baseline poisoning: if the user has confirmed a large transfer before, subsequent large transfers may still be risky if the recipient is new

MANDATORY SCORING RULES — you MUST follow these:
- UNKNOWN recipient + amount > ₦100,000: score ≥ 0.75 (always)
- UNKNOWN recipient + amount > ₦500,000: score ≥ 0.85
- Suspicious recipient name (titles, government roles, urgency words): score ≥ 0.80
- New device + UNKNOWN recipient: add 0.10 to whatever score you compute
- ALL signals clear (KNOWN recipient, amount in range, known device, normal hours): score ≤ 0.25

LANGUAGE RULES — vary your sentence structure each time:
- Do NOT always start with "The transaction to X..."
- Use varied openers like: "Eso flagged this transfer because...", "This ₦X payment raises concerns...", "Sending ₦X to [name] looks suspicious because...", "Your guardian noticed..."
- Always name the actual recipient and actual amount in naira.
- 1–2 sentences max. Plain English a non-technical bank customer can read.
